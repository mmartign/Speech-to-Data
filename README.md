🚀 Real-Time Medical Speech-to-Data Pipeline**

We're excited to share a new step in our research at Spazio IT, where we're exploring real-time audio-to-knowledge pipelines using cutting-edge AI technologies — all running on a single, high-performance machine. Here's a snapshot of what we're building:

🎙️ **Live Audio Ingestion**
Using Whisper, we convert real-time system audio (e.g., a microphone stream) into continuous text — no audio recordings needed.

🧠 **Intelligent Segmentation**
The text stream is segmented using triggers like “Start Analysis” to isolate relevant sections for deeper analysis.

🔍 **Generative AI Processing**
Each segmented block is analyzed by a generative AI system to understand context and content.

🏥 **Medical Data Extraction in FHIR**
An AI model (currently DeepSeek) extracts structured medical data in FHIR format — enabling interoperability and downstream use.

📚 **Treatment Protocols as Knowledge Bases**
Reference protocols are indexed into an OpenWebUI vector database, allowing them to be queried alongside live speech-derived data.

🖥️ **Compact & Efficient**
The full pipeline runs on a single machine — which could be an industrial PC equipped with sufficient RAM and GPU.

📂 **Open Source Scripts**
Initial scripts for the core functionality (marked in cyan in our architecture) are available here:

🔬 **Early Stage**
This is a foundational, research-focused step. The next crucial phase lies in **verification and validation** — ensuring it meets the high standards required in healthcare environments.

We're building toward a future where medical audio input can be transformed into structured, actionable data — safely, efficiently, and on the edge.
